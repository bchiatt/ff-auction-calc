Fantasy Football Auction Calculator
===============
This is self-assigned personal interest project to complete after my first week of developer bootcamp. I am creating it to practice what I've learened in a complex problem.

This app is guaranteed to lead you to fantasy football league domination.*

The script allows you to enter:
- starting budget amount
- position names
- position budgeted amounts

As you draft players, the app will update and display your re-allocated budget for the remaining players.

Thus, if you budgeted $10 for a player and ended up spending $15, the $5 deficit will be distributed out accourding to the weighted value of the remaining players. Hence, a $20 position may become a $18 position while a $10 may become $9.

*results may vary.
